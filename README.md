# What is this

Macro is a silly little game automation thing. It started as recording user mouse + keyboard movements at a pretty decent frequency in order to mimic human movements. I'm not exactly sure if this is helpful at all but I've heard of inhuman movement detection being used to ban bots so I thought I would make something for this. It's just an idea.

Right now I'm just making a me specific script for farming a silly game. I can't spend 1 billion hours grinding!!! I have things to do!!!!!

# To do

-> Change mouse positioning to percentage of screen size instead of hardcoded coords!

- Portability !!!!!!!!

-> Create nester / nestee scripts?  

- How can we sync them? Can it just be random? Keep it simple. \
- Can we run multiple instances of roblox on one mac? I know it can be done on windows but actually controlling two instances concurrently would be annoying. Not impossible tho. 

-> Create mut checker 

- Honestly this could just be pixel color detection. There's no need for image detection if the UI/screen positioning won't change (it won't) \
- We could sort various pixels colours into muts we want, and get rid of/sacrifice those we don't

-> State flow diagram? 

- This is a planning step. Just map out a flowchart to keep track of where to bot is (ie. main_menu -[hit play]-> in_game -[press k]-> stat_screen etc etc) \
- Will be good for not driving me insane
